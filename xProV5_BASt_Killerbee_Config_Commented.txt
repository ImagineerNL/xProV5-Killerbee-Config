; Commented Base Settings for xPro V5 on a Ratrig Killerbee
; Made by BASt (www.bast-hout.nl/ratrig )
; xPro V5 settings Wiki : https://github.com/Spark-Concepts/xPro-V5/wiki/Changing-settings
; Uncommented version of this file so you can compare it with your file:
; Get your settings by typing in console: $S or Settings/List
; Compare your file with my file on : https://www.diffchecker.com
; Settings are based on motor wiring according to the ratrig Dozuki: https://ratrig.dozuki.com/Guide/10.+Wiring+Diagrams/67?lang=en
; Position of machine is based on GRBL position, NOT on Ratrig position, so:
; 1) BACK is where Y motors are, moving Y+ is to the back, Y- is to the front.
; 2) Left is where X motor is. Moving X+ is to the right, X- is to the left.
; This should match the view in the xPro webcontrol / cncjs / Openbuilds Control.
; 3) Top is where Z motor is. Z+ moves up, Z- moves down
; 4) Machine Coordinate 0,0,0 is X max RIGHT, Y Max Back, Z at TOP.
; 5) But Homing Location is: X max LEFT, Y Max Back, Z at TOP

; You can enable Self Squaring Y Axes if you have an extra limit switch, following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcH7lrortzg 
; My setup is with a Kress / AMB Spindle. Adjust to your spindle
; Kress/AMB Spindles MUST be wired through the Relay!
; My setup is a 1075. Adjust Maxtravel to your size. For reference, see Working volume in Ratrig Critical Dimensions: https://ratrig.dozuki.com/Guide/00.+BOM+&+Machine+Critical+Dimensions/75?lang=en https://d3t0tbmlie281e.cloudfront.net/igi/ratrig/JK1jbYmcCKNeRKAm.large
; My setup is bolted directly to the table and the spoilboard bolted to the table as well (so no alu extrusions underneith), gaining about 4cm.

$Homing/Cycle0=Z ; First raise and home the Z height to its max position
$Homing/Cycle1=XY ; Then home X and Y to their respective home
$Homing/Cycle2= ; If you have the Self Squaring Y Axes you can add $Homing/Cycle2=Y to automatically square your Y Axis during homing

$Report/StallGuard=
$Stepper/Enable/Delay=0
$Stepper/Direction/Delay=0
$Stepper/Pulse=4
$Stepper/IdleTime=255 ; Time before steppers are disabled when idle. 255 is never disable, so it doesnt move unless you tell it to

$Firmware/Build=
$Limits/Soft=On ; Stop the machine travelling past distances set in $../MaxTravel. Note, the move doesnt stop when triggering a limitswitch, unless in a homing move.
$Limits/Hard=Off ; This is up to you. By turning this on, the machine stops moving after triggering a limitswitch and raise an alarm which can only be reset by resetting the controller. This is a safetyfeature, but since we only have a switch on one end, it still isnt fully safe.
$Homing/Enable=On ; always enable homing.
$Homing/DirInvert=X ; See point 5) above
$Homing/Squared=N ; Set this to Y if you have Self Squaring Y Axes

$Coolant/Delay/TurnOn=1.000
$Spindle/Delay/SpinDown=0.000 ; Your spindle takes time to spin down to 0. Set the delay here, or in your postprocessor. Kress/AMB Spindles take about 5 seconds to spin down.
$Spindle/Delay/SpinUp=0.000 ; Your spindle takes time to spin up to its set speed. Set the delay here, or in your postprocessor. Kress/AMB Spindles take about 5 seconds to spin up.
